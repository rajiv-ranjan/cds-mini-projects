They would like to know what this would do to their production capability. Specifically, they would like an example of a demand they could not meet with only plants 2 and 3, and also what effect having plant 4 has (recall it is identical to plant 3). They would also like an example of a demand that they could meet with just plants 2 and 3. Any general statements you could make here would be helpful."
